/**
 * Provides the controller components of the application, following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.
 * This package is responsible for managing the flow of data between the model and the view.
 * It contains classes that handle user input, update the model based on that input, and refresh the view to reflect any changes.
 *
 * Key classes in this package include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>ArgumentParser</b>: Parses command-line arguments and validates their format for use within the application.</li>
 *   <li><b>Controller</b>: Manages the game logic and interactions between the model and view components, ensuring the correct flow of data.</li>
 *   <li><b>Game</b>: Represents the overall game state and logic, coordinating gameplay activities and player interactions.</li>
 *   <li><b>GameInstance</b>: Manages an instance of the game, including initializing game settings, tracking the current state, and managing player turns.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Classes in this package work between the model and view packages to create an organized application structure.
